#
# This script performs the following tasks:
#
# - Merges the current release branch into master
# - Applies a tag to master
# - Merges
# - Pushes the updated master branch and its tag to upstream
#
# - develop: Our development branch.  We merge all PRs into this branch.
# - release-$version: A local branch containing commits specific to this release.
#   This is a local-only branch, we never push this anywhere.
# - master: Our "clean" release branch.  Contains tags.
#
# The relationships between the three branches are illustrated below:
#
#   github.com PRs
#          \
# develop --+--+----------------------------------+---
#               \                                /
#   (new branch) \ commits (CHANGELOG.md, etc)  /
#                 \   v                        /
# release          ---*-----X (delete branch) / (merge 2)
#                         \                  /
#                (merge 1) \       TAG      /
#                           \       v      /
# master  -------------------+------*-----+-----------

# Expects smart_open/version.py to be correctly incremented for the new release.
