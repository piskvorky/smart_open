NAME
    smart_open

DESCRIPTION
    Utilities for streaming to/from several file-like data storages: S3 / HDFS / local
    filesystem / compressed files, and many more, using a simple, Pythonic API.

    The streaming makes heavy use of generators and pipes, to avoid loading
    full file contents into memory, allowing work with arbitrarily large files.

    The main functions are:

    * `open()`, which opens the given file for reading/writing
    * `parse_uri()`
    * `s3_iter_bucket()`, which goes over all keys in an S3 bucket in parallel
    * `register_compressor()`, which registers callbacks for transparent compressor handling

FUNCTIONS
    open(uri, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None, compression='infer_from_extension', transport_params=None)
        Open the URI object, returning a file-like object.

        The URI is usually a string in a variety of formats.
        For a full list of examples, see the :func:`parse_uri` function.

        The URI may also be one of:

        - an instance of the pathlib.Path class
        - a stream (anything that implements io.IOBase-like functionality)

        Parameters
        ----------
        uri: str or object
            The object to open.
        mode: str, optional
            Mimicks built-in open parameter of the same name.
        buffering: int, optional
            Mimicks built-in open parameter of the same name.
        encoding: str, optional
            Mimicks built-in open parameter of the same name.
        errors: str, optional
            Mimicks built-in open parameter of the same name.
        newline: str, optional
            Mimicks built-in open parameter of the same name.
        closefd: boolean, optional
            Mimicks built-in open parameter of the same name.  Ignored.
        opener: object, optional
            Mimicks built-in open parameter of the same name.  Ignored.
        compression: str, optional (see smart_open.compression.get_supported_compression_types)
            Explicitly specify the compression/decompression behavior.
        transport_params: dict, optional
            Additional parameters for the transport layer (see notes below).

        Returns
        -------
        A file-like object.

        Notes
        -----
        smart_open has several implementations for its transport layer (e.g. S3, HTTP).
        Each transport layer has a different set of keyword arguments for overriding
        default behavior.  If you specify a keyword argument that is *not* supported
        by the transport layer being used, smart_open will ignore that argument and
        log a warning message.

        smart_open supports the following transport mechanisms:

        Implements reading and writing to/from HDFS.

        http/https (smart_open/http.py)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Implements file-like objects for reading from http.

        url: str
            The URL to open.
        mode: str
            The mode to open using.
        kerberos: boolean, optional
            If True, will attempt to use the local Kerberos credentials

            Any headers to send in the request. If ``None``, the default headers are sent:
            ``{'Accept-Encoding': 'identity'}``. To use no headers at all,
            set this variable to an empty dict, ``{}``.
        session: object, optional
            The requests Session object to use with http get requests.
            Can be used for OAuth2 clients.
        buffer_size: int, optional
            The buffer size to use when performing I/O.

        s3/s3n/s3u/s3a (smart_open/s3.py)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Implements file-like objects for reading and writing from/to AWS S3.

        bucket_id: str
            The name of the bucket this object resides in.
        key_id: str
            The name of the key within the bucket.
        mode: str
            The mode for opening the object.  Must be either "rb" or "wb".
        buffer_size: int, optional
            The buffer size to use when performing I/O.
        min_part_size: int, optional
            The minimum part size for multipart uploads, in bytes.
            When the writebuffer contains this many bytes, smart_open will upload
            the bytes to S3 as a single part of a multi-part upload, freeing the
            buffer either partially or entirely.  When you close the writer, it
            will assemble the parts together.
            The value determines the upper limit for the writebuffer.  If buffer
            space is short (e.g. you are buffering to memory), then use a smaller
            value for min_part_size, or consider buffering to disk instead (see
            the writebuffer option).
            The value must be between 5MB and 5GB.  If you specify a value outside
            of this range, smart_open will adjust it for you, because otherwise the
            upload _will_ fail.
            For writing only.  Does not apply if you set multipart_upload=False.
        multipart_upload: bool, optional
            Default: `True`
            If set to `True`, will use multipart upload for writing to S3. If set
            to `False`, S3 upload will use the S3 Single-Part Upload API, which
            is more ideal for small file sizes.
            For writing only.
        version_id: str, optional
            Version of the object, used when reading object.
            If None, will fetch the most recent version.
        defer_seek: boolean, optional
            Default: `False`
            If set to `True` on a file opened for reading, GetObject will not be
            called until the first seek() or read().
            Avoids redundant API queries when seeking before reading.
        range_chunk_size: int, optional
            Default: `None`
            If set to an integer value, S3 requests will be made in chunks
            of this size in bytes. This is useful for reading small portions of
            large files, as it prevents S3-compatible storage systems from
            internally queueing up the entire file when only a small portion
            will be read. When None (default), a single request will be made
            for the whole file, which can help to minimize per-request costs on S3.
        client: object, optional
            The S3 client to use when working with boto3.
            If you don't specify this, then smart_open will create a new client for you.
        client_kwargs: dict, optional
            Additional parameters to pass to the relevant functions of the client.
            The keys are fully qualified method names, e.g. `S3.Client.create_multipart_upload`.
            The values are kwargs to pass to that method each time it is called.
        writebuffer: IO[bytes], optional
            By default, this module will buffer data in memory using io.BytesIO
            when writing. Pass another binary IO instance here to use it instead.
            For example, you may pass a file object to buffer to local disk instead
            of in RAM. Use this to keep RAM usage low at the expense of additional
            disk IO. If you pass in an open file, then you are responsible for
            cleaning it up after writing completes.

        ssh/scp/sftp (smart_open/ssh.py)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Implements I/O streams over SSH.

        path: str
            The path to the file to open on the remote machine.
        mode: str, optional
            The mode to use for opening the file.
        host: str, optional
            The hostname of the remote machine. May not be None.
        user: str, optional
            The username to use to login to the remote machine.
            If None, defaults to the name of the current user.
        password: str, optional
            The password to use to login to the remote machine.
        port: int, optional
            The port to connect to.
        connect_kwargs: dict, optional
            Any additional settings to be passed to paramiko.SSHClient.connect.
        prefetch_kwargs: dict, optional
            Any additional settings to be passed to paramiko.SFTPFile.prefetch.
            The presence of this dict (even if empty) triggers prefetching.
        buffer_size: int, optional
            Passed to the bufsize argument of paramiko.SFTPClient.open.

        webhdfs (smart_open/webhdfs.py)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Implements reading and writing to/from WebHDFS.

        http_uri: str
            webhdfs url converted to http REST url
        min_part_size: int, optional
            For writing only.

        Examples
        --------

        >>> from smart_open import open
        >>>
        >>> # stream lines from an S3 object
        >>> for line in open('s3://commoncrawl/robots.txt'):
        ...    print(repr(line))
        ...    break
        'User-Agent: *\n'

        >>> # stream from/to compressed files, with transparent (de)compression:
        >>> for line in open('tests/test_data/1984.txt.gz', encoding='utf-8'):
        ...    print(repr(line))
        'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\n'
        'Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile\n'
        'wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not\n'
        'quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.\n'

        >>> # can use context managers too:
        >>> with open('tests/test_data/1984.txt.gz') as fin:
        ...    with open('tests/test_data/1984.txt.bz2', 'w') as fout:
        ...        for line in fin:
        ...           fout.write(line)
        74
        80
        78
        79

        >>> # can use any IOBase operations, like seek
        >>> with open('s3://commoncrawl/robots.txt', 'rb') as fin:
        ...     for line in fin:
        ...         print(repr(line.decode('utf-8')))
        ...         break
        ...     offset = fin.seek(0)  # seek to the beginning
        ...     print(fin.read(4))
        'User-Agent: *\n'
        b'User'

        >>> # stream from HTTP
        >>> for line in open('http://example.com/index.html'):
        ...     print(repr(line))
        ...     break

        This function also supports transparent compression and decompression
        using the following codecs:

        * .bz2
        * .gz
        * .xz
        * .zst

        The function depends on the file extension to determine the appropriate codec.

    register_compressor(ext, callback)
        Register a callback for transparently decompressing files with a specific extension.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ext: str
            The extension.  Must include the leading period, e.g. `.gz`.
        callback: callable
            The callback.  It must accept two position arguments, file_obj and mode.
            This function will be called when `smart_open` is opening a file with
            the specified extension.

        Examples
        --------

        Instruct smart_open to use the `lzma` module whenever opening a file
        with a .xz extension (see README.rst for the complete example showing I/O):

        >>> def _handle_xz(file_obj, mode):
        ...     import lzma
        ...     return lzma.LZMAFile(filename=file_obj, mode=mode)
        >>>
        >>> register_compressor('.xz', _handle_xz)

        This is just an example: `lzma` is in the standard library and is registered by default.

    s3_iter_bucket(bucket_name, prefix='', accept_key=None, key_limit=None, workers=16, retries=3, **session_kwargs)
        Deprecated.  Use smart_open.s3.iter_bucket instead.

    smart_open(uri, mode='rb', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None, ignore_extension=False, **kwargs)
